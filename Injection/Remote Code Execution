Remote Code Execution (RCE) – Injection Lab (Hub 2)
Overview

In this lab, I explored Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerabilities, which allow attackers to execute arbitrary commands on a server.

RCE is one of the most critical vulnerabilities because it can lead to full system compromise.

Objective

The objective was to:

Understand how command injection leads to RCE

Inject system commands

Observe server-side command execution

What is RCE?

Remote Code Execution occurs when:

User input is passed to system commands

Input is not properly validated

Attackers inject OS-level commands

RCE Challenge 1 – Basic Command Injection
Payload Used
; whoami

Result

Server returned the current system user

Confirmed command execution

Explanation

The semicolon (;) terminated the original command and executed a new one.

RCE Challenge 2 – Advanced Command Injection
Payload Used
&& ls


or

| id

Result

Listed server files or user details

Explanation

Logical operators allow chaining commands.

Security Impact

Read sensitive files

Install malware

Gain full server control

Conclusion

This lab demonstrated how unsanitized input can lead to full server compromise through RCE.
