Local File Inclusion (LFI) – Injection Lab (Hub 2)
Overview

In this lab, I explored Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerabilities, which allow attackers to read files from the server’s filesystem.

Objective

The objective was to:

Understand file path traversal

Exploit insecure file inclusion

Read sensitive system files

What is LFI?

LFI occurs when:

User input controls file paths

Path traversal is not prevented

LFI Challenge 1 – Basic File Inclusion
Payload Used
../../../../etc/passwd

Result

Displayed system user accounts

LFI Challenge 2 – Filter Bypass
Payload Used
....//....//....//etc/passwd


or

../../../../etc/passwd%00

Result

File inclusion bypassed filters

Security Impact

Read configuration files

Leak credentials

Combine with RCE for full compromise

Conclusion

This lab demonstrated how file path manipulation can expose sensitive server data.
