File Upload Attacks – Injection Lab (Hub 2)
Overview

In this lab, I explored File Upload vulnerabilities, which occur when applications allow unsafe file uploads without validation.

Objective

The objective was to:

Upload malicious files

Bypass file validation

Execute uploaded payloads

What is a File Upload Attack?

Occurs when:

File type validation is weak

Uploaded files are executable

No proper server-side checks exist

File Upload Challenge 1 – Unrestricted Upload
Payload Used

A PHP web shell:

<?php system($_GET['cmd']); ?>

File Name
shell.php

Result

File uploaded successfully

Commands executed via browser

File Upload Challenge 2 – Filter Bypass
Techniques Used

Double extension:

shell.php.jpg


MIME type manipulation

Result

Upload bypassed restrictions

Server executed the file

Security Impact

Full server compromise

Persistent backdoor access

Conclusion

This lab demonstrated how improper file upload validation leads to severe security risks.
