Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) – Injection Lab (Hub 2)
Overview

In this lab, I explored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities as part of the Injection section in Hub 2. The goal was to understand how improper input handling allows attackers to inject malicious JavaScript code into web applications.

XSS is a client-side injection attack where malicious scripts are executed in the victim’s browser.

Objective

The objective of these challenges was to:

Understand how XSS vulnerabilities occur

Identify different types of XSS

Inject JavaScript payloads into vulnerable inputs

Observe script execution in the browser

What is XSS?

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) occurs when:

User input is not properly sanitized

Malicious JavaScript is injected

The browser executes the script as trusted content

Why XSS is dangerous:

Steals cookies and sessions

Performs actions as the victim

Redirects users to malicious sites

XSS Challenge 1 – Reflected XSS
Description

This challenge involved injecting JavaScript into an input field where the output was reflected directly on the page without filtering.

Payload Used
<script>alert('XSS')</script>

Result

The alert box executed successfully

This confirmed a Reflected XSS vulnerability

Explanation

The application took user input and displayed it back without sanitization, allowing JavaScript execution.

XSS Challenge 2 – Stored XSS
Description

In this challenge, user input was stored in the backend and later rendered to other users.

Payload Used
<script>alert('Stored XSS')</script>

Result

Script executed every time the page loaded

Affected all users viewing the page

Explanation

This is more dangerous than reflected XSS because the payload is permanently stored.

XSS Challenge 3 – DOM-Based XSS
Description

This challenge involved JavaScript manipulating user input directly in the browser.

Payload Used
<img src=x onerror=alert('DOM XSS')>

Result

JavaScript executed without server interaction

Explanation

The vulnerability existed entirely in client-side JavaScript.

Conclusion

Through these challenges, I learned how XSS vulnerabilities arise from improper input handling and how JavaScript execution can be abused to compromise users.
