Shodan – Asset Discovery Lab (Hub 1)
Overview

In this lab, I used Shodan as part of the Asset Discovery section in Hub 1. The goal was to understand how internet-connected devices and services can be discovered using public search engines.

Shodan is different from traditional scanners because it searches for devices, not websites.

Objective

The objective of this task was to:

Understand what Shodan is

Discover exposed internet-facing assets

Identify services running on IP addresses

Learn how misconfigured services are exposed publicly

What is Shodan?

Shodan is a search engine for internet-connected devices.

It indexes:

Servers

Routers

Webcams

IoT devices

Open ports and services

Shodan collects banner information from publicly accessible systems.

Why Shodan is Important in Asset Discovery

Shodan allows attackers and defenders to:

Find exposed services

Identify outdated software

Discover misconfigured systems

Map real-world attack surfaces

Task Execution and Techniques Used
1️⃣ Searching by Domain

I searched for assets related to a domain:

hostname:targetdomain.com

2️⃣ Searching by IP Address
net:192.168.1.0/24


This identifies devices within a network range.

3️⃣ Searching by Service or Port
port:22


or

http.title:"login"


These queries reveal specific services or login pages.

Key Observations

Shodan reveals real-world exposed services

Some assets may not appear in DNS records

Data includes software versions and banners

Misconfigured services are easily discoverable

Security Impact

Exposed services may lead to:

Unauthorized access

Information leakage

Exploitation of known vulnerabilities

Shodan shows how easily attackers can find exposed systems.

Limitations of Shodan

Depends on previously indexed data

Some information may be outdated

Advanced features require an API key

Conclusion

This lab demonstrated how Shodan is used to discover publicly exposed assets on the internet. I learned how attackers can leverage search queries to identify vulnerable systems without directly scanning targets.

Shodan highlights the importance of proper network configuration and exposure management.
